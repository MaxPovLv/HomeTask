        <p> Homer Jay Simpson is the main protagonist and one of the five main characters of The Simpsons
            series (or show). He is the spouse of Marge Simpson and father of Bart, Lisa and Maggie Simpson. Homer is
            overweight (said to be ~240 pounds), lazy, and often ignorant to the world around him. Although Homer has
            many flaws, he has shown to have great caring, love, and even bravery to those he cares about and,
            sometimes, even others he doesn't. He also serves as the main protagonist of the The Simpsons Movie.

        <p> Marjorie Jacqueline "Marge" Simpson is the homemaker and was sometimes
            strict and a full-time crazy mom of the Simpson family. She is also one of the five main characters in The
            Simpsons TV series. She is also one of She and her husband Homer have three children: Bart, Lisa, and
            Maggie. Marge is the moralistic force in her family and often provides a grounding voice in the midst of her
            family's antics by trying to maintain order in the Simpson household. Aside from her duties at home, Marge
            has flirted briefly with a number of careers ranging from a police officer to an anti-violence activist.

        <h2>Bart Simpson</h2>

        <img src="img/Bart_Simpson.png " alt="Bart Simpson" class="img">

        <p> Bart was born on February 23 where he lit Homer's tie on fire after ten minutes of being born. His birth date
            explains his prankster-like behavior. Bart is a self-proclaimed underachiever and prankster who is constantly in
            detention who in addition to his behavior is easily distracted. His penchant for shocking people began before he
            was born: Bart "mooned" Dr. Hibbert while he performed a sonogram on Marge when she
            was pregnant with him, and moments after being born, he set Homer's tie on fire (Marge saying that he could
            not have done it on purpose because he was only ten minutes old). Bart's first words were "Ay Caramba"
            after he walked in on Homer and Marge at a bad time.

        <h2>Lisa Simpson</h2>

        <img src="img/Lisa_Simpson.png " alt="Lisa Simpson" class="img">

        <p> Lisa Marie Simpson (born May 9 1981) is the elder daughter and middle child of the Simpson family and one
            of the two tritagonists (along with Marge,) of The Simpsons series. In Homer and Lisa Exchange Cross Words she
            is also known as Lisa Bouvier. She was named after a train called
            Lil' Lisa on her parents' 1st anniversary. She is a charismatic 8-year-old girl, who exceeds the standard
            achievement of the intelligence level of children her age. Not to everyone's surprise, she is also the moral
            center of her family. In her upbringing, Lisa lacks parental involvement of Homer and Marge, which leads to
            hobbies such as playing saxophone and guitar, riding and caring for horses, and interest in advanced
            studies.

        <h2>Maggie Simpson</h2>

        <img src="img/Maggie_Simpson.png " alt="Maggie Simpson" class="img">

        <p> Margaret Evelyn Lenny "Maggie" Simpson (born January 12) is the 1-year old daughter and youngest child of
            Marge and Homer Simpson, the baby sister to Bart and Lisa Simpson, and one of the five main characters of The
            Simpsons. She is often seen sucking on her pacifier, and when she walks, she trips over her clothing and falls
            on her face. Because she rarely ever talks, Maggie is the least seen and heard in the Simpson family.Despite
            being the only member of the Simpson family who hasn't actually learned how to speak, Maggie is in no way
            one-dimensional and has different personality layers. She appears to be somewhat detached from the rest of her
            family and is once described as "the forgotten Simpson" by Homer.
